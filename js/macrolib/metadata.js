		/*d:
			(storylet: Lambda) -> Metadata

			When placed in a passage, it marks that passage as a storylet, using the lambda as the condition on which it's available, so that other macros,
			like (open-storylets:), can see the passage.

			Example usage:

			* `(storylet: when $season is "winter" and $married is false and visits is 0)`
			* `(storylet: when "mortuary" is in (history: ))`

			Rationale:
			Storylets are mini-stories within a story - disconnected sequences of passages that can be visited non-linearly when certain conditions are fulfilled.
			They allow a different way of writing interactive fiction than the rigid tree structure of typical Twine games: instead,
			simply write scenes and events that occur in the story, use this macro in the first passage of these mini-stories to write a programming condition that
			determines when it would make sense for that scene to occur, and use macros like (open-storylets:) to dynamically create links to the storylets.
			This authoring style allows content to be added to the story without having to dramatically rearrange the story's structure.

			Examples of narrative structures that can be represented as storylets include: jobs on a job board that are available at different times but only
			acceptable once; encounters in a role-playing-game that vary based on randomness and location; random dream sequences between linear chapters;
			chores to perform in a housekeeping or farming simulation. Simply create clumps of passages containing each of these sequences, mark the first passage
			of each with this macro, and make the end of each (or a central "hub" passage that they link back to) with code that uses (open-storylets:)
			to create links elsewhere.

			Details:
			Being a metadata macro, a (storylet:) macro call must appear in the passage *before* every other non-metadata macro in the passage, such as (set:) and (if:).
			(This doesn't include macros inside a "header" tagged passage.) The recommended place to put it is at the top of the passage. This restriction is because
			the (storylet:) call's lambda is only ever checked outside the passage. Variable-changing macros in the passage, such as (set:), are not run until the
			passage is visited, even if they appear before a (storylet:) macro. So, the code `(set: $a to 2)(storylet: when $a is 2)` is misleading, because it won't
			cause $a to always be 2 when the lambda is checked.

			Inside a (storylet:) macro's lambda, the "visit" and "visits" identifiers refer to the containing passage, so they will often be 0. Checking visits
			(such as by `visits is 0`) allows you to make a storylet only be available once (because after that, it will have become visited). Also,
			the "exits" identifier cannot be used here (because it's meaningless in this context).

			Having multiple (storylet:) macros in a passage results in an error when (open-storylets:) is used.

		/*d:
			(metadata: [...Any]) -> Metadata

			When placed in a passage, this adds the given names and values to the (passage:) datamap for this passage.

			Example usage:
			* `(metadata: "danger", 4, "hint", "Dragon teeth are fire-hardened, and dragon fillings must be fire-resistant.")` in a passage
			named "Dragon dentistry" causes `(passage:"Dragon dentistry")'s danger` to be 4, and `(passage:"Dragon dentistry")'s hint` to equal the given string.
			* `(metadata: "rarity", 5)` in a passage called "Adamantium" causes `(passage: "Adamantium")'s rarity` to be 5. You can then use
			`(passages: where it contains 'rarity' and its rarity >= (random: 1, 10))` to get a list of passages that may randomly exclude the "Adamantium" passage.

			Rationale:

			While the (passage:) and (passages:) datamaps can provide the tags, name and source code of your story's passages by default,
			there are many cases when you need more specific data than just strings, such as a number or a changer. An example is when making links for
			passages that have been chosen non-deterministically, such as by (open-storylets:) - you may want the link to be accompanied with a short description fitting
			the passage, or you may want each passage to have a random chance of not appearing at all. Moreover, you want to be able to write this information inside
			the passage itself, as you write it, just as tags are written on the passage as you write it.

			The (metadata:) macro provides this functionality - it augments the (passage:) datamap for the current passage,
			adding extra data of your choosing to it, as if by adding a (dm:) to it at startup.

			Details:

			The data names and values are provided to (metadata:) as if it was a (dm:) macro call â€“ first the string names, then the values, in alternation.

			Being a metadata macro, a (metadata:) macro call must appear in the passage *before* every other non-metadata macro in the passage, such as (set:) and (if:).
			(This doesn't include macros inside a "header" tagged passage.) The recommended place to put it is at the top of the passage.

			Every passage's (metadata:) macro is run just once, at startup. If an error occurs while doing so (for instance, if a value is given without a matching name)
			then a dialog box will appear at startup, displaying the error.

			Since passages already have "source", "name" and "tags" data names in their datamap, trying to use these names in a (metadata:) macro will produce an error.

			Putting this in a "header", "startup" or "footer" tagged passage will NOT cause this metadata to be applied to every passage, much as how adding extra tags
			to a "header", "startup" or "footer" tagged passage will not cause those tags to apply to every passage.
