		/*d:
			(link-goto: String, [String]) -> Command
			
			Takes a string of link text, and an optional destination passage name, and makes a command to create

			This command should not be attached to a hook.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(link-goto: "Enter the cellar", "Cellar")` is approximately the same as `[[Enter the cellar->Cellar]]`.
			* `(link-goto: "Cellar")` is the same as `[[Cellar]]`.

			Rationale:
			This macro serves as an alternative to the standard link syntax (`[[Link text->Destination]]`), but has a couple of
			slight differences.

			* The link syntax lets you supply a fixed text string for the link, and an expression for the destination
			passage's name. However, it does not provide any other means of computing the link. (link-goto:) also
			allows the link text to be any expression - so, something like `(link-goto: "Move " + $name + "to the cellar", "Cellar")`
			can be written.

			* The resulting command from this macro, like all commands, can be saved and used elsewhere.
			If you have a complicated link you need to use in several passages, you could (set:) it to a variable and use that variable
			in its place.

			Details:
			As a bit of trivia... the Harlowe engine actually converts all standard links into (link-goto:) macro calls internally -
			the link syntax is, essentially, a syntactic shorthand for (link-goto:).

			You may, as part of customising your story, be using (replace:) to change the ?sidebar, and remove its
			default "undo" link. If so, you can selectively provide undo links at certain parts of your story instead,
			by using this macro.

			Details:
			As with (undo:), if this command is used on the play session's first turn, an error will be produced (as there
			is yet nothing to undo at that time). You can check which turn it is by examining the `length` of the (history:)
			array.

		/*d:

			Creates a link that, when clicked, shows the given hidden hooks, running the code within.

			Example usage:
			`But those little quirks paled before (link-show: "her darker eccentricities.", ?twist)`

			Rationale:
			As discussed in the documentation for (show:), that macro is intended as a complement to (click-replace:) (or perhaps
			(click-append:)). While both let you insert text at a location when a link is clicked, they differ in whether they let the
			author write the initial text or the replacement text at the location when coding the passage.

			Typical (click-append:) usage resembles the following, where the inserted text provides supplementary content to the passage's
			prose, and is written separately from it:

			```
			Ah. You remember her eldest well - [a frail, anxious child]<more|. Unlikely to raise too much of a fuss.

			(click-append: ?more)[, constantly frowning, mumbling every word they utter, flinching at the slightest noise]
			```

			Conversely, typical (show:) usage resembles the following, where the inserted text is a continuation of the passage's prose,
			and is written together with it:

			```
			"Look, it's important to comment even the simplest code...|more)[ You might remember what it does now, but not at 4:50 PM on Friday
			afternoon, when you're about to push to production and a runtime error shows up in it.]"

			You (link-reveal:"struggle to listen.")[(show: ?more)]
			```

			The (link-show:) macro provides a convenient shorthand for the latter example, letting you write the final line as
			`You (link-show: "struggle to listen.", ?more)`.

			Details:
			As with most link macros, providing this with an empty link text string will result in an error.

			As with (show:) and (click:), providing this with a hook which is already visible, or which doesn't even exist,
			will NOT produce an error, but simply do nothing.

		This is a convenient combination of the (link-reveal:) and (go-to:) macros, designed to let you run commands like (set:)

		Example usage:
		 * `(link-reveal-goto: "Study English", "Afternoon 1")[(set:$eng to it + 1)]` will create a link reading "Study English"
		which, when clicked, adds 1 to the $eng variable using (set:), and then goes to the passage "Afternoon 1".
		 * `(link-reveal-goto: "Fight the King of England", "Death")[(alert:"You asked for it!")]` will create a link reading
		 "Fight the King of England" which, when clicked, displays an alert using (alert:), and then goes to the passage "Death".
		
		Details:

		Note that there is already an idiom for checking if a passage was visited earlier in the game: `(history: ) contains "Passage name"`
		checks if the passage named "Passage name" was visited. So, you don't necessarily need to use this macro to record that the player
