	/*d:
		Bind data

		A few macros that produce interactive elements, like (cycling-link:), have the ability to automatically update a variable whenever the
		player interacts with them. There needs to be a way to specify which variable these will update: simply giving the macro the variable
		itself, such as in `(cycling-link: $hat, "Poker visor", "Beret")`, won't work - the value that's currently inside `$hat` will be given
		instead, as one would expect for every other kind of macro. So, the `bind` keyword is needed to make your intent unambiguous:
		`bind $hat` produces a "bound variable".

		One can bind any kind of variable: story-wide variables like `$morality`, temp variables like `_glance`, and data values and positions
		inside them, like `$diary's 1st's event`. Once bound, the macro's element will set data to it automatically, as if by a series of
		unseen (set:)s or (move:)s.

		Note that bound variables can't be (set:) into variables themselves, because there's no real point to doing so (and it could lead to
		a lot of undue confusion).

		| Operator | Purpose | Example
		|---
		| `bind` | Binds the named variable on the right. | `bind $weapon`, `bind _hat`, `bind $profile's age`
