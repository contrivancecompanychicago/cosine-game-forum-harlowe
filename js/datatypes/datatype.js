		A Pattern is the fundamental primitive in pattern-matching in Harlowe. A single Datatype

		but other than that, they resist most others.

		Datatype data

		If you want to check if a variable's data is a certain type - for instance, that a variable that should only hold a number does indeed
		do so - then you can use these special values to do the comparison. To check if the data in $money is a number, write `$money is a num`.

		Warning: you must write `is a` - don't write `$money is num`, because `is` by itself checks if the left side exactly equals the right side, and `num` represents all numbers, not the specific number contained in $money.

		All of the datatypes are as follows.

		| Value | Data type
		|---
		| `number`, `num` | Numbers
		| `string`, `str` | Strings
		| `boolean` | Booleans
		| `array` | Arrays
		| `datamap`, `dm` | Datamaps
		| `dataset`, `ds` | Datasets
		| `command` | Commands
		| `changer` | Changers
		| `color`, `colour` | Colours

		Note that data that can't be stored in a variable doesn't have a corresponding datatype name, because you won't need to compare things to it.

		Additionally, along with the `is a` operator, there is a `matches` operator which is useful when you're dealing with data structures like arrays or datamaps. `$pos is a array` checks if $pos is an array, but that may not be precise enough for you. `$pos matches (a: number, number)` checks to see if $pos is an array containing only two numbers in a row. A data structure with datatype names in various positions inside it is called a **pattern**, and `matches` is used to compare data values and patterns.

		Some more pattern-matching examples:

		* `(datamap:'a',2,'b',4) matches (datamap:'b',num,'a',num))` is true.
		* `(a: 2, 3, 4) matches (a: 2, num, num)` is true. (Patterns can have exact values in them, which must be equal in the matching data).
		* `(a: (a: 2), (a: 4)) matches (a: (a: num), (a: num))` is true.

		To summarise, the two datatype-checking operators are:

		| Operator | Purpose | Example
		|---
		| `matches` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the data on the left matches the pattern on the right. | `(a:2,3) matches (a: num, num)`
		| `is a`, `is an` | Similar to `matches`, but requires the right side to be just a type name. | `(a:2,3) is an array`, `4.1 is a number`
