		Gradient data

		Gradients are special composite data values which can be provided to (background:). Much as colour data
		represents a single colour that can be used with (text-colour:) or (background:), gradients represent
		special computer-generated backgrounds that smoothly transition from one colour on one side, to another colour
		on its other side, with any number of other colours in between.

		For an in-depth description of how to create gradients, see the article for (gradient:).

		Gradients, like colours, have a few data values you can examine, but cannot (set:).

		| Data name | Example | Meaning
		|---
		| `angle` | `$grad's angle` | The angle, a number from 0 to 359. If a value outside this range was given to `(gradient:)`, this will return that value wrapped to this range.
		| `stops` | `$colour's stops` | An array of the gradient's colour-stops. Each stop is a datamap containing "percent" and "colour" data names. <br>`(gradient: 90, 0.2, blue, 0.8, white)'s stops` is `(a:(dm: "percent", 0.2, "colour", blue), (dm: "percent", 0.8, "colour", white))`.

		Gradients, when used in passage prose or given to (print:), produce a square swatch containing the gradient. This is a `<tw-colour>`
		element, but otherwise has no other features or capabilities and is intended solely for debugging purposes.
