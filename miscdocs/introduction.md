Introduction 2: Some of what's new in 3.1

Harlowe 3.1, ostensibly a minor release of Harlowe, nonetheless has a surprising amount of new features, which are summarised as follows:

 * New implementations of (alert:), (confirm:) and (prompt:) that should work in more browsers and browser-like environments, and whose dialogs are customisable with CSS.
 * The identifiers <a href="#keyword_visits">visits</a> and <a href="#keyword_exits">exits</a>.
 * Special data names for <a href="#type_hookname">hooks</a>: `?hook's links`, `?hook's chars` and `?hook's lines`.
 * Subarray and substring data names, such as `$arr's 1stto3rd`.
 * New macros: (cond:), (nth:), (more:), (passages:) and (gradient:).
 * <a href="#markup_unclosed-hook">Unclosed hook markup</a>, a shorthand that you can use with changers.

For a complete list of changes and outlines of how to use the above features, consult the <a href="#changes_3.1.0-changes">change log</a> section.
